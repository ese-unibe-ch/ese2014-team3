\subsection{Clear and distinct test cases}
There are 8 test classes, distributed over two groups(each in their own package), controller tests, and service tests. There are also two testsuites, each with a different number of tests. Although some tests appear in both testsuites, none of the testsuites contains all 8 tests. Moreover, we note that some of the tests in the service test package seem tot be testing data access objects directly and not services. Although the idea behind the organisation of the tests is good, the implementation lacks consistency and is confusing. The fact that no javadoc is provided for most of the tests doesn't help either.
